# cayde
cayde is a RV32I processor written in SystemVerilog. It is a single-cycle implementation.

### Features
- It can run RV32I instructions. 
- Other extensions and instructions can be added in the package.

### Feature Suggestion
- Improve the core.
- Add M extensions.
- Verify the core.
- Add a pipelined version.
- Add hazard detection.

### Instructions to synthesize the core.

You can use any synthesis tool to run this code. I have used [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) and [sv2v](https://github.com/zachjs/sv2v) here. 

### Instructions to simulate/verify the core.
